# giticky
A dumb git and filesystem based ticket system with a browser interface in Python Flask

for some reason my earlier commits were credited as budisaga or whatev

## gitick.py
this script will be used to generate and manage new projects, tickets, users,
and other git commands.  for now, you can launch it with python3 and use the
new() and add() functions to make a new project and add tickets

## gitick-view
gitick-view.py expects a directory called 'gitick-projects' that can have 
directories and subdirectories with .md files.  this project root can be 
changed in the gitick-view.cfg file
